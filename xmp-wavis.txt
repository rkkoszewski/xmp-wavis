--------------------------------------------

This plugin for XMPlay loads and displays Winamp visualization plugins.

When xmp-wavis.dll is copied somewhere under the XMPlay directory,
it can be found under the 'Options and stuff' screen on the DSP page.

An added VIS wrapper will first have no plugin loaded. To load a plugin,
open the configuration of the wrapper plugin. It will list all loadable
Winamp plugins that can be found under the directory of XMPlay.
To load a plugin outside of the XMPlay directory, use the '...' button.

You can add multiple 'Winamp Vis Wrapper' DSP plugins and run them at
the same time as long as you don't load the same Winamp plugin DLL twice.

To configure the wrapped Winamp visualization plugin, click the 'Configure'
button in the option screen.

The plugin also registers an XMPlay shortcut 'Winamp Visualization on/off',
which toggles the running state of all plugins that have been set up.


Notes:

 - To load the same Winamp Visualization plugin multiple times,
   copy the DLL to force a new loaded instance of it.

  Release source code, cleaned up internals, tested with Windows 10
  Replace KISS FFT library with fft.hpp a public domain library by Alexander Nadeau


[2009_02_03 - rev.6]

  Don't show error message when starting XMPlay after an active wrapped plugin DLL has been removed,
  just cancel the loading of the entire wrapper plugin in that case.


[2008_12_05 - rev.5]

  Better support/response for certain player commands (fast forward/rewind/volume control/etc).
  New version numbering akin to other XMPlay plugins.


[2008_12_04 - 0.9.4 (rev.4)]

  Small update which makes the in plugin playlist work better (P key in MilkDrop).


[2008_11_26 - 0.9.3 (rev.3)]

  Unicode fixes usable for MilkDrop 2.0e.
  Shows title in unicode and has the full playlist (P key in MilkDrop).

  Sadly this introduces the requirement for unicows.dll for Windows 9x (supported since 0.9.2)
  If you need this DLL, google or email me. I tested with unicows.dll 1.1.3790, 258352 bytes.


[2008_10_06 - 0.9.2 (rev.2)]

  Fixes for Windows 98 \o/


[2008_08_08 - 0.9.1 (rev.1)]

  Frees up memory and stops buffering of samples when not wrapped vis plugin is running.


[2008_08_05 - 0.9.0 (first release)]

  First version. Based heavily on its predecessor XMPlay Vis Plugin 'winamp_svp'.
  It also adds a lot of features including the option to load multiple plugins, nicer
  configuration and no need to have the XMPlay visualization window open.

  The only feature missing from the old plugin is the disabling of info bubbles while
  visualizations are displayed. Means you'll see volume changes and song changes in tray
  even when full screen visualization is active.
